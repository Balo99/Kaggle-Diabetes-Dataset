# Kaggle - Diabetes Dataset
Project for the Unsupervised Learning course, part of the Machine Learning for Modeling course in the Artificial Intelligence for Science and Technology Master Degree
The objective of this project was to implement unsupervised learning tecniques to predict having the Diabetes on a given dataset.

## Goal of the project
Due to the fact that this project has been developed in an exam optic, it differ with respect to the description of the competition on Kaggle.
In particular the following tasks have been studied:
- Preprocessing: an initial phase dedicated to cleaning the dataset
- Implementation of different clustering algorithms: K-Prototype, K-Mode, Hierarchical Clustering
- Evaluation of the algorithms both in a supervised and unsupervised way
- Implementation of the Shapley Values

## Structure of the Notebook
The Notebook follows the structure of the Goal. 
This Notebook will show basic examples of:
### Data Handling
* Data uploading using Pandas
* Cleaning Data
* Data Exploration
* Correlation Matrix

### Data Analysis
* Clusterability
* Outliers Detection
* Clustering

### Validation of the results
* Supervised Evaluation
* Unsupervised Evaluation

### Explainable AI
* Study of the Shapley Values
